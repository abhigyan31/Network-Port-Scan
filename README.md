<img src="Screenshots/nps.png" alt="nps" width="666"/>
This repository contains the work for Task 1 of my cybersecurity internship. The task involved scanning a local network to identify active hosts and open TCP ports.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Kali Linux (VMware)
- Nma

## ðŸ§© Task Steps
1. Installed Nmap
2. Identified local IP range using 'ip a'
3. Performed a TCP SYN scan using Nmap
4. Noted down live hosts and open ports
5. (Optionally) Analyzed packets with Wireshark
6. Researched services and potential security risks
7. Saved scan results as '.txt'

## âœ… Summary
No high-risk services found. 
Only one host ('192.168.121.2') had port '53' (DNS) open.
The task helped understand port scanning, host discovery, and basic network auditing.
